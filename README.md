# Crowdsensing-ASC

Simulation of a crowdsensing app that collects and computes noise pollution data. 

The simulated system consists of mobile devices that have data about the noise
levels in various locations. These devices periodically receive scripts that
apply an algorithm on the values collected for a location by them or the devices
they encounter during the simulation.
